# Employee Directory

## Overview

An employee directory with React. Breaks up the application's UI into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Description

The user is given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees is rendered. 

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table results by first and last name.

  * Filter the users by first or last name by typing in the search box.
